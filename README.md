# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization using Pygame

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It provides a user-friendly interface using the Pygame library, allowing users to input a graph, visualize it on a Pygame window, and calculate the shortest path between specified nodes. The visualization highlights the algorithm's step-by-step execution, and the shortest path is dynamically displayed on the graph.
